Play my asteroids game via https://timm50.github.io/asteroid-play/asteroid2

Sometimes an asteroid hits the ship just as you enter the game. You will need to refresh the page... or also down arrow cloaks the ship so the asteroids can't kill you. You can start with the down arrow pressed and you will not need to refresh the page as you enter the game.
